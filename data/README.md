# CAUTION!  

The tubes were selected and organized based on the original morphological identifications. Many individuals in the *Tetramorium* genus were identified differently based on mitochondrial DNA. Currently, **the folders are organized with the original incorrect identifications**. The R script aligns the tube numbers with the correct species names.
