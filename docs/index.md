# Opération Fourmis
## Morphological trait variation

![img](https://wp.unil.ch/fourmisvaud/files/2019/03/Titre_OrangeViolet.png)

This repository analyzes patterns of variation in morphological traits for ants collected during [Opération Fourmis](https://wp.unil.ch/fourmisvaud/), a citizen science project in Vaud, Switzerland in 2019. See the links below for project development and preliminary results.

## Other Opération Fourmis repositories  

- [Citizen science EDA](https://sz-tim.github.io/5_citsci/): Exploratory data analysis focused on the samples collected in the citizen science component. Questions about differences in the ant species found among habitat and land uses, as well as citizen science methodology.  
- [Diversity, richness, and abundance](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/CH_diversity): Hierarchical Bayesian Poisson Point Process model that integrates the structured abundances and unstructured presence-only data to predict local and regional communities across the canton.  
- [General EDA and functions](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/opfo): Base repository for Opération Fourmis, including general EDA, QC/QA, and functions used in the other repositories.
