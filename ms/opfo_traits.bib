abstract = {Understanding the link between ecology and morphology is a fundamental goal in biology. Ants are diverse terrestrial organisms, known to exhibit ecologically driven morphological variation. While relationships between individual traits and ecologies have been identified, multidimensional interactions among traits and their cumulative predictive power remain unknown. As selective pressures may generate convergent syndromes spanning multiple traits, we applied multivariate analyses across a wide sampling of taxa to assess ecomorphological variation in an integrative context. How well does morphology predict ecology? Moreover, are there quantitatively supported ant ecomorphs? We investigated the links between trait morphology and ecology by assembling a morphometric dataset spanning over 160 species within 110 genera. As ants occupy a wide range of ecologies, we compiled natural history data on nesting microhabitat, foraging stratum and functional role into 35 defined niche combinations. This tripartite ecological classification and our morphological dataset were optimized under dimension reduction techniques including principal component analysis, principal coordinate analysis, linear discriminant analysis and random forest supervised machine learning. Our results describe ant ecomorphospace as comprising regions of shared, generalized morphology as well as unique phenotypic space associated with specialized ecologies. Dimension reduction and model-based approaches predict ecology with 77{\%}–85{\%} accuracy and Random Forest analysis consistently outperforms LDA. While accounting for shared ancestry, we found eye, antennal scape and leg morphology to be most informative in differentiating among ecologies. We also note some heterogeneity between trait significance in each ecological aspect (nesting niche, foraging niche, functional role). To increase the utility of ecomorphological classification we simplified our 35 observed niche combinations into 10 ecomorph syndromes, which were also predicted by morphology. The predictive power of these machine learning methods underscores the strong role that ecology has in convergently shaping overall body plan morphology across ant lineages. We include a pipeline for predictive ecomorphological modelling using morphometric data, which may be expanded with additional specimen-based and natural history data.

abstract = {The environment is thought to strongly shape the ecology and evolution of species. Similar environments may cause species to look the same or converge upon particular traits. Dissimilar environments can cause species to look different or to diverge in their traits. These ideas have been explored at the single species level or within restricted geographic areas for ants. We ask whether the signature of environmental filtering can be detected within ant faunas at the biogeographic scale. We quantify differences in the morphological traits of ant faunas between two contrasting biomes: a rainforest in Costa Rica and a desert in Iran. Lists of species from each habitat type were compiled, and measurements of ten functional traits were taken from scaled images. Body size, relative femur length, and tibia length were significantly smaller in Costa Rica suggesting species in more complex environments are smaller in response to environmental complexity. Relative eye width was also smaller in Costa Rica, and individuals were lighter in colour. Eye size and body pigmentation showed differences which may be a result of altered foraging patterns or protection against UV-B irradiance. The Costa Rican fauna also had a much wider trait space (higher functional richness), and Iranian species occupied a narrow range in terms of mandible and leg size suggesting species invest less in foraging specialism in unproductive environments. Significant differences in morphological traits and their degree of overlap can therefore be observed in ant faunas occupying contrasting biomes. We suggest that this is due to the environment influencing the trait composition of these faunas at biogeographic scales.},

@article{Arnan2014a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 British Ecological Society. Understanding species distributions and diversity gradients is a central challenge in ecology and requires prior knowledge of the functional traits mediating species' survival under particular environmental conditions. While the functional ecology of plants has been reasonably well explored, much less is known about that of animals. Ants are among the most diverse, abundant and ecologically significant organisms on earth, and they perform a great variety of ecological functions. In this study, we analyse how the functional species traits present in ant communities vary along broad gradients in climate, productivity and vegetation type in the south-western Mediterranean. To this end, we compiled one of the largest animal databases to date: it contains information on 211 local ant communities (including eight climate variables, productivity, and vegetation type) and 124 ant species, for which 10 functional traits are described. We used traits that characterize different dimensions of the ant functional niche with respect to morphology, life history and behaviour at both individual and colony level. We calculated two complementary functional trait community indices ('trait average' and 'trait dissimilarity') for each trait, and we analysed how they varied along the three different gradients using generalized least squares models that accounted for spatial autocorrelation. Our results show that productivity, vegetation type and, to a lesser extent, each climate variable per se might play an important role in shaping the occurrence of functional species traits in ant communities. Among the climate variables, temperature and precipitation seasonality had a much higher influence on functional responses than their mean values, whose effects were almost lacking. Our results suggest that strong relationships might exist between the abiotic environment and the distribution of functional traits among south-western Mediterranean ant communities. This finding indicates that functional traits may modulate the responses of ant species to the environment. Since these traits act as the link between species distributions and the environment, they could potentially be used to predict community changes under future global change scenarios.},

abstract = {Ecogeographical rules that associate climate with organismal form and function can reveal patterns of climatic adaptation. Two rules link animal coloration with climate: Gloger's rule (darker coloration where wet and warm), and Bogert's rule (darker coloration where cold). Whereas Gloger's rule was proposed for endotherms, and Bogert's rule for ectotherms, both rules may apply more broadly, despite their seemingly opposing effects. Here, we test this contradiction on a global scale across passerine birds. Consistent with Gloger's rule, birds were darker in wetter areas and, following Bogert's rule, lighter where warm, although birds became lighter again at very low temperatures. Rainfall and temperature had antagonistic or additive effects depending on their pattern of covariation, and this predicted whether birds followed the rules. We integrate both rules into a general framework to explain heterogeneity in climatic effects on coloration, which has implications to understand patterns of diversification, climatic adaptation and climate change impacts.},

abstract = {Morphological traits provide the interface between species and their environment. For example, body size affects the fitness of individuals in various ways. Yet especially for ectotherms, the applicability of general rules of interspecific clines of body size and even more so of other morphological traits is still under debate. Here we tested relationships between elevation (as a proxy for temperature) and productivity with four ecologically relevant morphological traits of orthopteran assemblages that are related to fecundity (body size), dispersal (wing length), jumping ability (hind femur length), and predator detection (eye size). We measured traits of 160 orthopteran species that were sampled along an extensive environmental gradient at Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), spanning elevations from 790 to 4,410 m above sea level (a.s.l.) with different levels of plant productivity. For traits other than body size, we calculated the residuals from a regression on body length to estimate the variation of traits irrespective of body size. Bayesian analyses revealed that mean body size of assemblages, as well as the means of relative wing length, hind femur length, and eye size, decreased with increasing elevation. Body size and relative eye size also decreased with increasing productivity. Both phylogenetic relationships, as well as species-specific adaptations, contributed to these patterns. Our results suggest that orthopteran assemblages had higher fecundity and better dispersal and escape abilities, as well as better predator detection at higher temperatures (low elevations) than at low temperatures (high elevations). Large body sizes might be advantageous in habitats with low productivity because of a reduced risk of starvation. Likewise, large eye size might be advantageous because of the ability to detect predators in habitats with low vegetation cover, where hiding possibilities are scarce. Our study highlights that changes in temperature and productivity not only lead to interspecific changes in body size but are also related to independent changes of other morphological traits that influence the ecological fit of organisms in their environment.},

abstract = {Bergmann's rule states that individuals of a species/clade at higher altitudes or latitudes will be larger than those at lower ones. A systemic review of the known literature on inter- and intraspecific variation in insect size along latitudinal or altitudinal clines was done to see how often such clines appeared and whether they reflected classwide, species-specific, or experimentally biased tendencies. Nearly even numbers of studies showed Bergmann clines and converse-Bergmann clines, where insects get smaller as latitude/altitude increases. In fact, the majority of studies suggested no clines at all. Small ranges may have obscured certain clines, while giant ranges may have introduced artifacts. Researchers examining interspecific patterns found clines less frequently than those examining intraspecific patterns because of variation among species within the clades, which renders interspecific studies unhelpful. Bergmann's rule does not apply to hexapods with nearly the same consistency as it does to endothermic vertebrates. The validity of Bergmann's rule for any group and range of insects is highly idiosyncratic and partially depends on the study design. I conclude that studies of Bergmann's rule should focus within species and look at widespread but contiguous populations to account for all sources of variation while minimizing error.},

We studied whether worker size and size difference between opponents had an effect on aggression during conspecific encounters. Although the capacity to recognize nestmates was shared by all individuals, some patterns of agonistic behaviors were size related. Escape was mostly displayed by the small workers, and threat, associated with ritualized fights, by the large workers. As game theory predicted, ants of C. niger adjusted their level of aggression as a function of the size of the opponent. However, only large individuals used such assessment strategies, responding with escalation of aggression towards small workers and reduction of aggression towards large ones. On the contrary, small individuals behaved in the same manner whatever the opponent's size. Differences between both morphological castes were discussed with reference to the resource holding assessment models. Aggr. Behav. 25:369-379, 1999. {\textcopyright} 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Gloger's rule is usually interpreted as predicting darker coloured animals in warmer and more humid/vegetated regions. The relative importance of temperature and rainfall or vegetation is however unclear, and often only one variable is tested at a time, mainly through proxies. Here, I assess the predictions of Gloger's rule for interspecific achromatic plumage variation (dark to light variation) for an entire avifauna (551 species of Australian landbirds). I tested the effects of climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and vegetation structure on plumage reflectance at species and assemblage level (100 × 100 km cells), controlling for phylogenetic relatedness and spatial autocorrelation. To assess the robustness of these results I compared observed results with those of a null distribution of effects obtained from repeatedly simulating random plumage reflectance evolution on the phylogeny. At both the species and assemblage level, darker coloured birds were found in wetter and colder regions and in more densely vegetated habitats. Simulations confirm results at the species level and the effect of temperature at the assemblage level, but rainfall and vegetation effects at the assemblage level fall within the distribution of simulated effects and should be interpreted with care. Interspecific colour variation in Australian birds supports Gloger's rule for rainfall/vegetation, but shows the opposite pattern for temperature. Darker colours in wet and vegetated environments are consistent with the role of melanin pigmentation in preventing feather degradation by bacteria, but also with background-matching for camouflage. Darker plumage might be beneficial in colder regions or detrimental in warmer regions if it affects thermoregulation, a selective force often only assumed to be of importance for ectotherms. The data highlight the need to test the generality of biogeographic rules across levels and at broad scale. Experimental work is needed to confirm the mechanisms linking plumage achromatic variation to climate.},

abstract = {Insect societies vary greatly in social organization, yet the relative roles of ecological and genetic factors in driving this variation remain poorly understood. Identifying how social structure varies along environmental gradients can provide insights into the ecological conditions favouring alternative social organizations. Here, we investigate how queen number variation is distributed along elevation gradients within a socially polymorphic ant, the Alpine silver ant Formica selysi. We sampled low- and high-elevation populations in multiple Alpine valleys. We show that populations belonging to different drainage basins are genetically differentiated. In contrast, there is little genetic divergence between low- and high-elevation populations within the same drainage basin. Thus, elevation gradients in each of the drainage basins represent independent contrasts. Whatever the elevation, all well-sampled populations are socially polymorphic, containing both monogynous (= one queen) and polygynous (= multiple queen) colonies. However, the proportion of monogynous colonies per population increases at higher elevation, while the effective number of queens in polygynous colonies decreases, and this pattern is replicated in each drainage basin. The increased prevalence of colonies with a single queen at high elevation is correlated with summer and winter average temperature, but not with precipitation. The colder, unpredictable and patchy environment encountered at higher elevations may favour larger queens with the ability to disperse and establish incipient monogynous colonies independently, while the stable and continuous habitat in the lowlands may favour large, fast-growing polygynous colonies. By highlighting differences in the environmental conditions favouring monogynous or polygynous colonies, this study sheds light on the ecological factors influencing the distribution and maintenance of social polymorphism.},

abstract = {Individual search behavior is an important feature of ant ecology that can be influenced by many factors including environmental constraints, competitive interactions, and morphology. In this study, I investigated the effects of temperature, body size, and leg allometry on search movement in the polymorphic European harvester ant, Messor wasmanni. Temperature is known to increase movement speed, but how it interacts with morphology to influence path sinuosity is unknown. Ants in this study were grouped according to dimension (small, medium, and large) and were filmed moving individually in a neutral arena at three different temperatures: 10, 20, and 30 °C. Movements were analyzed by evaluating mean speed, path length, and path complexity using 5 different indexes to survey tortuosity: Mean Square Displacement (MSD), Straightness (ST), Intensity of Habitat Use (IU), Sinuosity (SI), and Fractal Dimension (Fractal D). Search movement seemed not to be strongly affected by size, even though extreme temperatures faintly diversified the path complexity among castes. Finally, the relationship between body weight and leg length was evaluated to test the ‘size-grain' hypothesis among dimensional castes. Mean speed was strongly affected by temperature, but not by the size of the ants. Complexity indexes revealed different outcomes through their relationship to speed or path length. Interestingly, leg length and body size were negatively correlated, indicating that legs are proportionally shorter in large rather than in small ants, causing rejection of the ‘size-grain' hypothesis for this species. Thus, individuals experience a similar roughness of soil surface irrespective of their size.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Biological Reviews published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd on behalf of Cambridge Philosophical Society. In focusing on how organisms' generalizable functional properties (traits) interact mechanistically with environments across spatial scales and levels of biological organization, trait-based approaches provide a powerful framework for attaining synthesis, generality and prediction. Trait-based research has considerably improved understanding of the assembly, structure and functioning of plant communities. Further advances in ecology may be achieved by exploring the trait–environment relationships of non-sessile, heterotrophic organisms such as terrestrial arthropods, which are geographically ubiquitous, ecologically diverse, and often important functional components of ecosystems. Trait-based studies and trait databases have recently been compiled for groups such as ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, spiders and many others; however, the explicit justification, conceptual framework, and primary-evidence base for the burgeoning field of ‘terrestrial arthropod trait-based ecology' have not been well established. Consequently, there is some confusion over the scope and relevance of this field, as well as a tendency for studies to overlook important assumptions of the trait-based approach. Here we aim to provide a broad and accessible overview of the trait-based ecology of terrestrial arthropods. We first define and illustrate foundational concepts in trait-based ecology with respect to terrestrial arthropods, and justify the application of trait-based approaches to the study of their ecology. Next, we review studies in community ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to elucidate how assembly processes for terrestrial arthropod communities are influenced by niche filtering along environmental gradients (e.g. climatic, structural, and land-use gradients) and by abiotic and biotic disturbances (e.g. fire, floods, and biological invasions). We also review studies in ecosystem ecology where trait-based approaches have been used to investigate biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships: how the functional diversity of arthropod communities relates to a host of ecosystem functions and services that they mediate, such as decomposition, pollination and predation. We then suggest how future work can address fundamental assumptions and limitations by investigating trait functionality and the effects of intraspecific variation, assessing the potential for sampling methods to bias the traits and trait values observed, and enhancing the quality and consolidation of trait information in databases. A roadmap to guide observational trait-based studies is also presented. Lastly, we highlight new areas where trait-based studies on terrestrial arthropods are well positioned to advance ecological understanding and application. These include examining the roles of competitive, non-competitive and (multi-)trophic interactions in shaping coexistence, and macro-scaling trait–environment relationships to explain and predict patterns in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across space and time. We hope this review will spur and guide future applications of the trait-based framework to advance ecological insights from the most diverse eukaryotic organisms on Earth.},

In this study, we measured head widthes of the black garden ant Lasius niger workers using digital methods. The ants were sampled from 51 colonies originating from 19 sites located along a metal pollution gradient, established in a former mining area in Poland. Total zinc concentrations in random samples of small invertebrates were used as a measure of site pollution levels. We found that the skewness of head size distribution grows significantly in line with the pollution level of the site, ranging from values slightly below zero (about −0.5) in the least polluted site up to a positive value (about 1.5) in the most polluted site. This result indicates that the frequency of small ants grows as pollution levels increase. The coefficient of variation, as well as the measures of central tendency, was not related to the pollution level. Four hypotheses explaining the obtained results are proposed. The bias towards the higher frequency of small workers may result from energy limitation and/or metal toxicity, but may also have an adaptive function.},

abstract = {Both the mean forager size and the variability in forager size within colonies of ants are positively correlated with niche breadth on two dimension - size of foraging area and diet. In colonies that feed on seeds, absolute size of foragers is related to the size of seeds taken; in colonies that feed on insects, absolute size of the foragers is related to foraging distance. The percent variation in forager size is best correlated, in all colony types, with size of the foraging area. In island communities with fewer ant species, the mean forager size is smaller and the coefficient of variation in forager size greater. The presence of slaves was found to increase both range of foraging temperatures and the variety of foods utilized by slave-making colonies. *[Samples of 20 foragers per colony, 4 colonies per population, were used to estimate niche breadths. A total of 61 populations of 21 species, from 13 different communities in the western U.S.A. were sampled.

abstract = {Abstract: Within-colony phenotypic diversity can play an essential role in some eusocial insect taxa by increasing the performance of division of labor, thereby increasing colony fitness. Empirical studies of the effect of phenotypic diversity on colony fitness mostly focused on species with discrete castes (workers, soldiers) or with continuously and highly morphologically variable workers, which is not the most common case. Indeed, most species exhibit continuous but limited worker morphological variation. It is still unclear whether this variation impacts colony fitness. To test this, we reduced the worker size diversity in 25 colonies of the ant Temnothorax nylanderi and compared their performances to 25 control colonies. We reared these colonies in the laboratory and measured the effect of treatment (reduced diversity or control) and colony size (number of workers) on colony performance at six challenges, as well as on worker mortality and brood production. The reduction of worker size diversity did not affect colony performance nor mortality and brood production. As expected, colony performance and brood production increased with colony size. These results suggest that worker size diversity may not be under positive selection in this species, but rather the product of a lack of developmental canalization. We propose that social life could decrease the selective pressures maintaining developmental canalization, subsequently leading to higher size diversity without necessarily increasing colony performance. Significance statement: In social insects, nestmate size diversity is commonly thought to improve division of labour and colony performance. This has been clearly demonstrated in species with high size diversity, either discrete or continuous, but this is unclear in most of the social insects that exhibit low size diversity. We experimentally decreased worker size diversity in the ant Temnothorax nylanderi, a species with low worker size diversity. Reducing worker size diversity had no effect on colony performance, worker mortality, or brood production. Our findings support the hypothesis that low size diversity is merely the product of developmental noise and is not necessarily adaptive. We propose that social life could relax the selective pressures maintaining developmental and social canalizations, subsequently leading to size diversity.},

abstract = {Size has profound consequences for the structure and function of biological systems, across levels of organization from cells to social groups. As tightly integrated units that vary greatly in size, eusocial insect colonies, in particular, are expected to exhibit social scaling relations. To address the question of how social organization scales with colony size, we quantified task performance in variably sized colonies of the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus. We found a positive scaling relationship between colony size and division of labor in 2 different contexts. First, individual workers were more specialized in older, larger colonies. Second, division of labor increased with colony size, independently of colony age. Moreover, the proportional allocation of workers to tasks shifted during colony ontogeny-older, larger colonies performed relatively less brood care-but did not vary with colony size among same-aged colonies. There were no colony-size effects on per capita activity or the distribution of activity across workers. Size-related changes in task performance were correlated with changes in the rate of encounter between nest mates. These results highlight the importance of colony size for the organization of work in insect societies and raise broader questions about the role of size in sociobiology. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Royal Entomological Society In recent years the focus in ecology has shifted from species to a greater emphasis on functional traits. In tandem with this shift, a number of trait databases have been developed covering a range of taxa. Here, we introduce the GlobalAnts database. Globally, ants are dominant, diverse and provide a range of ecosystem functions. The database represents a significant tool for ecology in that it (i) contributes to a global archive of ant traits (morphology, ecology and life history) which complements existing ant databases and (ii) promotes a trait-based approach in ant and other insect ecology through a broad set of standardised traits. The GlobalAnts database is unique in that it represents the largest online database of functional traits with associated georeferenced assemblage-level data (abundance and/or occupancy) for any animal group with 9056 ant species and morphospecies records for entire local assemblages across 4416 sites. We describe the structure of the database, types of traits included and present a summary of data coverage. The value of the database is demonstrated through an initial examination of trait distributions across subfamilies, continents and biomes. Striking biogeographic differences in ant traits are highlighted which raise intriguing questions as to the mechanisms generating them.},

abstract = {Cataglyphis is a fairly homogeneous ant genus which is widespread over the arid regions of the Old World. All Cataglyphis species are thermal specialists which are adapted to extreme environments where they forage at nearly lethal temperatures. This study focusses on two Cataglyphis species which differ considerably in their physical caste systems. These species have developed two alternative mechanisms facing extreme heat. In C. velox, foraging at high surface temperatures is clearly dependent on size: large C. velox workers forage at midday and are able to withstand higher temperatures than small workers. On the other hand, C. rosenhaueri has not developed great physical specialization, but the workers of this species have achieved physiological (such as low cuticular transpiration and metabolic rate), and behavioural adaptations (such as raising their abdomen to protect the vital organs contained in it from high temperatures) to tolerate thermal stress. The result is that small C. rosenhaueri workers may withstand extreme heat conditions in a similar way to large C. velox workers, and much better than small C. velox workers. The different mechanisms used by these two species to withstand extreme heat could reflect fundamental patterns of independent evolution. In some situations, selection may act to promote a relatively narrow size range of adult workers, all of them able to withstand thermal extremes, while in others it may act by producing different worker sizes with different tolerance to environmental conditions.},

In Mediterranean ant communities, a close relationship has been found between activity rhythm in the period of maximum activity and position in the dominance hierarchy: subordinate species are active during the day, when conditions are more severe, while dominants are active during the afternoon and the night. 2. Results obtained in this study confirmed that the species foraging at higher temperatures were closer to their critical thermal limits than the species foraging at lower temperatures. 3. This enabled two extreme strategies of foraging in relation to temperature to be distinguished: (1) heat-intolerant ant species behaved as risk-averse species, foraging at temperatures very far from their critical thermal limits; and (2) heat-tolerant ant species behaved as risk-prone species, foraging very near their critical thermal limits and running a high heat mortality risk. 4. Heat-tolerant species benefited from this strategy by having better foraging performance at high temperatures. 5. This wide range of thermal niches may be one reason why Mediterranean ant faunas are so diverse in the face of limited diversity in vegetation and habitat structure: the daily range of temperature may be sufficiently great to meet the requirement both of heat-adapted and cold-adapted species as well as a spectrum of intermediate forms.},

abstract = {Division of labour among workers is central to the organisation and ecological success of insect societies. If there is a genetic component to worker size, morphology or task preference, an increase in colony genetic diversity arising from the presence of multiple breeders per colony might improve division of labour. We studied the genetic basis of worker size and task preference in Formica selysi, an ant species that shows natural variation in the number of mates per queen and the number of queens per colony. Worker size had a heritable component in colonies headed by a doubly mated queen (h 2=0.26) and differed significantly among matrilines in multiple-queen colonies. However, higher levels of genetic diversity did not result in more polymorphic workers across single- or multiple-queen colonies. In addition, workers from multiple-queen colonies were consistently smaller and less polymorphic than workers from single-queen colonies. The relationship between task, body size and genetic lineage appeared to be complex. Foragers were significantly larger than brood-tenders, which may provide energetic or ergonomic advantages to the colony. Task specialisation was also often associated with genetic lineage. However, genetic lineage and body size were often correlated with task independently of each other, suggesting that the allocation of workers to tasks is modulated by multiple factors. Overall, these results indicate that an increase in colony genetic diversity does not increase worker size polymorphism but might improve colony homeostasis. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Running speed increases with temperature in a manner consistent with the effects of temperature on metabolic rate and the kinetic properties of muscles. 3. The exponent of the body mass-running speed allometry ranged from 0.14 to 0.34 with a central tendency of approximately 0.25. This body mass scaling is consistent with both the model of elastic similarity, and a model combining dynamic similarity with available metabolic power. 4. Even after controlling for body size or temperature, a substantial amount of inter-specific variation in running speed remains. Species with certain lifestyles [e.g. nomadic group predators, species which forage at extreme ({\textgreater}60°C) temperatures] may have been selected for faster running speeds. 5. Although ants have a similar scaling exponent to mammals for the running speed allometry, they run slower than predicted compared with a hypothetical mammal of similar size.

We quantified the thermal microenvironments around tree branches in the tropical rainforest canopy, and explored the effects of substrate color on the internal body temperature and species composition of arboreal ants. Branch temperatures during the day (09:00–16:00) were hottest (often {\textgreater} 50 °C) and most variable on the upper surface, while the lowest and least variable temperatures occurred on the underside. Temperatures on black substrates declined with increasing distance above the surface in both the field and the laboratory. By contrast, a micro-scale temperature inversion occurred above white substrates. Wind events (ca. 2 m s−1) eliminated these patterns. Internal temperatures of bodies of Cephalotes atratus workers experimentally heated in the laboratory were 6 °C warmer on white vs. black substrates, and 6 °C cooler than ambient in windy conditions. The composition of ant species foraging at baits differed between black-painted and unpainted tree branches, with a tendency for smaller ants to avoid the significantly hotter black surfaces. Collectively, these outcomes show that ants traversing canopy branches experience very heterogeneous thermal microenvironments that are partly influenced in predictable ways by branch surface coloration and breezy conditions.},

abstract = {A persistent challenge in ecology is to tease apart the in- fluence of multiple processes acting simultaneously and interacting in complex ways to shape the structure of species assemblages. We implement a heuristic approach that relies on explicitly defining spe- cies pools and permits assessment of the relative influence of themain processes thought to shape assemblage structure: environmental fil- tering, dispersal limitations, and biotic interactions. We illustrate our approach using data on the assemblage composition and geographic distribution of hummingbirds, a comprehensive phylogeny and mor- phological traits. The implementation of several process-based species pool definitions in null models suggests that temperature—but not pre- cipitation or dispersal limitation—acts as the main regional filter of as- semblage structure. Incorporating this environmental filter directly into the definition of assemblage-specific species pools revealed an other- wise hidden pattern of phylogenetic evenness, indicating that biotic in- teractions might further influence hummingbird assemblage structure. Such hidden patterns of assemblage structure call for a reexamination of a multitude of phylogenetic- and trait-based studies that did not ex- plicitly consider potentially important processes in their definition of the species pool. Our heuristic approach provides a transparent way to explore patterns and refine interpretations of the underlying causes of assemblage structure.},

abstract = {In social insects, colony size is a crucial life-history trait thought to have major implications for the evolution of social complexity, especially in relation to worker size polymorphism. Yet, little is known about how ecological factors can affect and constrain colony. Here, we explored the pattern of colony-size and worker-size variation in the Mediterranean ant Cataglyphis cursor, in relation to the type of habitats colonized (seaside vs. vineyard). The high level of the water table in the seaside habitat could constrain the depth of C. cursor underground nests and directly constrain its colony size. If worker size increases with colony size, as observed in other ant species, larger colony size and larger workers should be found in the vineyard populations. By comparing worker size among 16 populations, we verified that workers were significantly larger in the vineyard populations. We further determined that the morphological similarities detected among populations from the same habitat type were not due to geographic or genetic proximity. In two populations from each habitat type, the depth of nests was positively correlated with colony size and colony size with worker size. Using a type II regression approach, we further showed that the difference between the two populations in the depth of nest was sufficient to explain the difference in colony size, and similarly, variation in colony size was sufficient to explain variation in worker size. Our results suggest that a single proximate ecological factor could lead to significant variation in major life-history parameters. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Abstract: This work uses a comparative framework to address the adaptive evolutionary relationship between nesting ecology and the morphological diversification of the soldier caste in turtle ants (Cephalotes). Turtle ant colonies nest in pre-existing arboreal cavities, and soldiers specialize in colony defense by blocking cavity entrances with their armored heads. Analyses were focused on three major axes of soldier morphological diversification: discrete morphotype, head size, and head-size range (i.e., soldier polymorphism). The analyses showed that while all species use some entrances small enough to fit the head of one soldier, specialization on entrances that tightly fit the head of one soldier was only seen in species with the most specialized soldier morphotype. They also showed that the degree of soldier polymorphism was only positively correlated with the typical range of entrances in species with the most specialized morphotype. Overall, these findings indicated that a tight 1:1 size-matching between available soldier head sizes and selected entrance sizes is limited to species with the most specialized soldier morphotype, while species with less specialized morphotypes use a broader range of larger entrances. Together, these findings suggest a new general hypothesis for the adaptive diversification of caste systems: major shifts in ecological specialization drive the evolution of novel caste morphotypes, while minor expansions and contractions of an existing resource range shape the evolution of the size distribution of an existing caste. Broadly, these findings highlight the possibility for complex coupling and decoupling between different axes of caste diversification in lineages with complex social phenotypes. Significance statement: One key way in which complex "organismal societies" have diversified in form and function is via the evolution of morphologically distinct "castes" that specialize on particular social roles. Nevertheless, how ecological interactions shape caste diversification within social lineages remains poorly understood. Using a comparative framework, this work addresses how nesting ecology has shaped the diversification of an elaborate soldier caste in the turtle ants. The evolution of more specialized soldier types was associated with substantial shifts in nest-entrance specialization, while in species with the most specialized soldier type, there was also a match between head sizes and entrance sizes within and across species. These findings suggest the general hypothesis that the evolution of novel caste types is driven by major shifts in ecological specialization, while the size distribution of existing castes tracks minor shifts in resource use.},

abstract = {An organism's morphology is constrained by its evolutionary history and the need to meet a variety of potentially competing functions. The ant genus Pheidole is the most species-rich ant genus and almost every species has a dimorphic worker caste (a few are trimorphic). This separation of workers into two developmentally distinct subcastes (smaller minors and larger majors with distinctively large heads) may partially release individuals from functional constraints on morphology, making Pheidole an ideal genus for addressing questions on the evolution of morphology in relation to ecological specialization. Major workers can perform a variety of tasks, although they are usually specialized for defence, as well as food retrieval and processing. Pheidole species vary in their diet, although many species gather seeds. The major workers mill the seeds using large jaws powered by mandible closer muscles that occupy a large proportion of the head cavity. In the present study, we examined the relationship between seed-harvesting and morphology in Pheidole, hypothesizing that majors of seed-harvesting species would have larger heads relative to non-seed-harvesters to accommodate the powerful mandibular muscles needed to mill seeds. By taking a phylogenetically controlled comparative approach, we found that majors of seed-associated Pheidole did not have larger heads (width and length) than majors of non-seed-harvesting species. However, the head length of minors (and to a lesser extent head width) was smaller in seed-harvesters. Additionally, we found the difference in head size between majors and minors was greater in seed-harvesting species. These morphological differences in diet, however, were not related to changes in the rate of evolution in either seed-harvesting or non-seed-harvesting lineages. These findings suggest that the morphologies of worker subcastes can evolve independently of each other, allowing colonies with polymorphic workers to specialize on new resources or tasks in ways not possible in monomorphic species.},

abstract = {Body size has been shown to decrease with increasing temperature in many species, prompting the suggestion that it is a universal ecological response. However, species with complex life cycles, such as holometabolous insects, may have correspondingly complicated temperature–size responses. Recent research suggests that life history and ecological traits may be important for determining the direction and strength of temperature–size responses. Yet, these factors are rarely included in analyses. Here, we aim to determine whether the size of the bivoltine butterfly, Polyommatus bellar- gus, and the univoltine butterflies, Plebejus argus and Polyommatus coridon, change in response to temperature and whether these responses differ between the sexes, and for P. bellargus, between generations. Forewing length was measured using digital specimens from the Natural History Museum, London (NHM), from one locality in the UK per species. The data were initially compared to annual and seasonal temperature values, without consideration of life history factors. Sex and generation of the indi- viduals and mean monthly temperatures, which cover the growing period for each species, were then included in analyses. When compared to annual or seasonal tem- peratures only, size was not related to temperature for P. bellargus and P. argus, but there was a negative relationship between size and temperature for P. coridon. When sex, generation, and monthly temperatures were included, male adult size decreased as temperature increased in the early larval stages, and increased as temperature increased during the late larval stages. Results were similar but less consistent for females, while second generation P. bellargus showed no temperature–size response. In P. coridon, size decreased as temperature increased during the pupal stage. These results highlight the importance of including life history factors, sex, and monthly temperature data when studying temperature–size responses for species with complex life cycles.},

abstract = {Bigger animals live longer. The scaling exponent for the relationship between lifespan and body mass is between 0.15 and 0.3. Bigger animals also expend more energy, and the scaling exponent for the relationship of resting metabolic rate (RMR) to body mass lies somewhere between 0.66 and 0.8. Mass-specific RMR therefore scales with a corresponding exponent between -0.2 and -0.33. Because the exponents for mass-specific RMR are close to the exponents for lifespan, but have opposite signs, their product (the mass-specific expenditure of energy per lifespan) is independent of body mass (exponent between -0.08 and 0.08). This means that across species a gram of tissue on average expends about the same amount of energy before it dies regardless of whether that tissue is located in a shrew, a cow, an elephant or a whale. This fact led to the notion that ageing and lifespan are processes regulated by energy metabolism rates and that elevating metabolism will be associated with premature mortality--the rate of living theory. The free-radical theory of ageing provides a potential mechanism that links metabolism to ageing phenomena, since oxygen free radicals are formed as a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation. Despite this potential synergy in these theoretical approaches, the free-radical theory has grown in stature while the rate of living theory has fallen into disrepute. This is primarily because comparisons made across classes (for example, between birds and mammals) do not conform to the expectations, and even within classes there is substantial interspecific variability in the mass-specific expenditure of energy per lifespan. Using interspecific data to test the rate of living hypothesis is, however, confused by several major problems. For example, appeals that the resultant lifetime expenditure of energy per gram of tissue is 'too variable' depend on the biological significance rather than the statistical significance of the variation observed. Moreover, maximum lifespan is not a good marker of ageing and RMR is not a good measure of total energy metabolism. Analysis of residual lifespan against residual RMR reveals no significant relationship. However, this is still based on RMR. A novel comparison using daily energy expenditure (DEE), rather than BMR, suggests that lifetime expenditure of energy per gram of tissue is NOT independent of body mass, and that tissue in smaller animals expends more energy before expiring than tissue in larger animals. Some of the residual variation in this relationship in mammals is explained by ambient temperature. In addition there is a significant negative relationship between residual lifespan and residual daily energy expenditure in mammals. A potentially much better model to explore the links of body size, metabolism and ageing is to examine the intraspecific links. These studies have generated some data that support the original rate of living theory and other data that conflict. In particular several studies have shown that manipulating animals to expend more or less energy generate the expected effects on lifespan (particularly when the subjects are ectotherms). However, smaller individuals with higher rates of metabolism live longer than their slower, larger conspecifics. An addition to these confused observations has been the recent suggestion that under some circumstances we might expect mitochondria to produce fewer free radicals when metabolism is higher--particularly when they are uncoupled. These new ideas concerning the manner in which mitochondria generate free radicals as a function of metabolism shed some light on the complexity of observations linking body size, metabolism and lifespan.},

abstract = {Ant colonies are superorganisms with emergent traits that, for some species, reflect the combined activity of physically distinct worker castes. Although larger castes have high production costs, they are thought to save their colonies energy by efficiently performing specialized tasks. However, because workers are generally idle until sensing specific stimuli, their maintenance costs may be an important component of colony-level investment. I used metabolic scaling to examine the maintenance costs of dimorphic major and minor Pheidole castes across levels of colony organization (e.g., individual, group, and colony). Majors from three species had lower mass-specific meta- bolic rates than minors because of allometries at both individual and group levels and subsequently lived longer when starved. Thus, large major castes may offset their production costs in both their idle and active states. The slope scaling metabolic rate from incipient to reproductive colonies of Pheidole dentata (∼colony mass0.89) fell between the slopes for minor groups (∼group mass1.04) and major groups (∼group mass0.79) and appears to reflect developmental shifts in subunit mass and number and their offsetting effects on per capita energy demands. These results highlight how metabolic scaling may help visualize the energetic correlates of emergent behavior and unravel the mechanisms governing colony organization.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI). Colony size is an incredibly important factor in social insect ecology: it affects everything from foraging strategies to colony defense to mating systems to the degree of polymorphism. However, colony sizes vary dramatically among ant species (Formicidae): sizes range from several workers living together to super-colonies that stretch for hundreds of kilometers. Although the origins of eusociality and colonial life have been extensively theorized, little work has been done describing the evolution of colony size that followed after. Our study provides the first large-scale investigation into such issues, incorporating colony size data from 118 genera and recently published, nearly complete genus-level molecular phylogenies. We find that colony size change exhibits a bifurcation pattern similar to the feedback loop theory posited by Bourke 1999. Once colony sizes become sufficiently large, they rarely undergo radical decreases in size on a macroevolutionary scale. Additionally, the magnitude of colony size changes seem relatively small: rarely do colony sizes jump from small to large sizes without first transitioning through an intermediate size. Lastly, we echo many previous authors in advocating for the release of unpublished sociometric data and a push toward its further acquisition.},

abstract = {Predicting and understanding the biological response to future climate change is a pressing challenge for humanity. In the 21st century, many species will move into higher latitudes and higher elevations as the climate warms. In addition, the relative abundances of species within local assemblages are likely to change. Both effects have implications for how ecosystems function. Few biodiversity forecasts, however, take account of both shifting ranges and changing abundances. We provide a novel analysis predicting the potential changes to assemblage-level relative abundances in the 21st century. We use an established relationship linking ant abundance and their colour and size traits to temperature and UV-B to predict future abundance changes. We also predict future temperature driven range shifts and use these to alter the available species pool for our trait-mediated abundance predictions. We do this across three continents under a low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Under RCP2.6, predicted changes to ant assemblages by 2100 are moderate. On average, species richness will increase by 26{\%}, while species composition and relative abundance structure will be 26{\%} and 30{\%} different, respectively, compared with modern assemblages. Under RCP8.5, however, highland assemblages face almost a tripling of species richness and compositional and relative abundance changes of 66{\%} and 77{\%}. Critically, we predict that future assemblages could be reorganized in terms of which species are common and which are rare: future highland assemblages will not simply comprise upslope shifts of modern lowland assemblages. These forecasts reveal the potential for radical change to montane ant assemblages by the end of the 21st century if temperature increases continue. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating trait–environment relationships into future biodiversity predictions. Looking forward, the major challenge is to understand how ecosystem processes will respond to compositional and relative abundance changes.},

abstract = {Body mass shapes processes from cell metabolism to community dynamics. Little is known, however, about how the average body mass of individuals varies among ecological communities. Ants alter colony mass by independently changing worker mass and/or worker number. In a survey of 49 ecosystems from tundra to tropical rainforest, average worker mass and worker number were uncorrelated (r(s) = 0.2, P {\textgreater} 0.14) and varied 100-fold. Data supported the hypothesis that higher mean monthly temperatures, T, reduce worker mass by increasing metabolic costs during worker development. In contrast, worker number was unimodal over a 1,000-fold gradient of net primary productivity (NPP, g of carbon per m2 per yr), a measure of organic carbon available to consumers. At the lowest levels of NPP colonies appeared to be carbon-limited; above 60 g of carbon per m2 per yr average worker number decreased to a global low. This decline in worker number with increasing NPP supports the hypothesis that abundant carbon ameliorates the Achilles heel of small taxa in competition with large taxa: their relatively high metabolic demands. Higher predation rates in resource-rich environments may also play a role in limiting worker number. In all, about half the global variation in worker mass and number was accounted for by gradients of NPP and T. Changes in global temperature and rainfall may thus mold gradients of ectotherm size, with consequences for the structure and function of the ecosystems.},

The ecological conditions that select for this phenomenon are still poorly understood. 2. We use a comparative analysis to address the hypothesis that prey type has selected for greater morphological diversity in the small, monophyletic army ant genus Eciton. These ants are nomadic group-predators and transport loads in the limited space below the body, so bulkier prey types should select for more diverse worker morphology. 3. We show that five Eciton species differ in the presence or absence of a distinct 'submajor caste', the morphological exaggeration of submajors when present, and the allometric scaling of standard workers over a broad size range. Crucially, the presence and morphological exaggeration of submajors is associated with the variety of awkwardly shaped prey types that the species takes, and this caste specializes in prey transport. 4. Our findings support the importance of dietary composition in the evolution of worker morphological diversity in Eciton and demonstrate the utility of our general approach. Future critical tests of this hypothesis are discussed, as well as how our approach can contribute to a broader understanding of the relationship between ecology and the evolution of worker morphological diversity. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Geographical variation in environmental temperatures is expected to impose clinal phenotypic selection that results in the expression of large-scale gradients of body mass variation within animal clades. Body size is predicted to increase with increasing latitude and elevation, and hence, with decreasing temperature, a pattern broadly known as Bergmann's rule. However, empirical observations are highly conflicting. Whilst most studies support this prediction in endotherms (birds and mammals), analyses conducted on ectotherms often fail to report this pattern. Does it reduce the validity of this macroecological rule? Since the original formulation of Bergmann's rule only involved endothermic organisms, I argue that the controversy is not a consequence of its predictive power, but a result of the later inclusion of ectotherms as part of the prediction. Here, I propose that the common conception of Bergmann's rule maintained for half a century is changed back to its original definition restricted to endotherms. This temperature-size relationship might therefore consolidate as a well-established macroecological rule if its original formulation is respected. Finally, I develop these claims on my initial suggestion that Bergmann's rule should be recognized as the evolutionary outcome of a general process with no phylogenetic scale distinction of species or populations, being equally applicable amongst and within species.},

abstract = {The worker caste of polymorphic ant species consists of individuals of strikingly different morphologies. Most studies of polymorphic species have focused on intracolonial allometries and their association with division of labour and task performance of workers of different physical subcastes. However, the factors driving the evolution of these allometries are poorly understood. Here, we analyse the importance of life-style (hypogaeic vs intermediate vs epigaeic) as a factor in the evolution of allometries of functionally important body traits in Dorylus army ants in the context of an evolutionary scenario according to which a hypogaeic life-style is the ancestral state in this group. To this end, we conducted a detailed comparative analysis of the allometries of nine characters for ten species belonging to all six currently recognized subgenera and showing different life-styles. Eight of the nine traits under consideration show a clear increase in relative size from hypogaeic to intermediate to epigaeic life-style. These results strongly suggest that shifts in ecological niche are linked with adaptations in these traits. The degree of overall differentiation among species is more pronounced in larger than in smaller workers. The pattern of division of labour in the epigaeic D. molestus indicates that two factors that may have caused this phenomenon are new food habits and an increased need for colony defence.

abstract = {Aims: Geographical gradients in body size have been extensively studied in endotherms, and general rules exist to describe body size variation in these animals. However, the existence of broad-scale patterns in body size variation in ectotherms remains largely debated. Turtles (tortoises and freshwater turtles) are ectothermic organisms whose geographical variation in body size has not been examined widely. Here, we test a suite of hypotheses, proposed to explain body size patterns in other animals, for this group of reptiles. Location: Global. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Turtles. Methods: We gathered distribution, phylogenetic and body size data for 235 species of turtles, which were distributed in a global equal area grid of 200 km × 200 km. We also obtained predictor variables [mean annual temperature, actual evapotranspiration, temperature variation since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and human footprint] directly associated with the main hypotheses tested in body size studies. Our analyses followed a cross-species and an assemblage-based approach and were performed for all turtles and for terrestrial and aquatic species separately. Results: Mean annual temperature was the main correlate of body size for the whole group and for terrestrial turtles in both approaches, having a positive correlation with this trait. Body sizes of aquatic turtles were not influenced by any of the tested variables. In the cross-species approach we also found that temperature variation since the LGM was an important positive correlate of body size in terrestrial turtles. Main conclusions: Our study reinforces the importance of environmental temperatures in explaining animal body size patterns. The heat balance hypothesis was not rejected by our data, whereas migration, productivity and human disturbance hypotheses were rejected. Finally, body size of terrestrial and aquatic turtles had different patterns, also suggesting that habitat is an important factor in understanding geographical variation in body size.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ectotherms are likely to be especially sensitive to rising temperatures over coming decades. Thermal limits are used to measure climatic tolerances that potentially affect ectotherm distribution. While there is a strong relationship between the critical thermal maximum (CT max) of insects and their latitudinal ranges, the nature of this relationship across elevation is less clear. Here we investigated the combined relationships between CT max , elevation and ant body mass, given that CT max can also be influenced by body mass, in the World Heritage-listed rainforests of the Australian Wet Tropics. We measured the CT max and body mass of 20 ant species across an elevational gradient from 350 to 1000 m a.s.l. Community CT max did not vary systematically with increasing elevation and there was no correlation between elevation and elevational ranges of species. However, body mass significantly decreased at higher elevations. Despite the negative correlation between CT max and body mass at the community level, there was no significant difference in CT max of different-sized ants within a species. These findings are not consistent with either the climatic variability hypothesis, Rapoport's rule or Bergmann's rule. Models indicated that elevation and body mass had limited influences on CT max . Our results suggest that the distribution of most montane ants in the region is not strongly driven by thermal limitation, and climate change will likely impact ant species differently. This is likely to occur primarily through changes in rainfall via its effects on vegetation structure and therefore thermal microhabitats, rather than through direct temperature changes.},

abstract = {Interspecific competition, a dominant process structuring ecological communities, is influenced by species' phenotypic differences. Limiting similarity theory holds that species with similar traits should compete intensely (‘trait-similarity'). In contrast, competing theories including modern coexistence theory emphasize that species with traits conferring competitive advantages should outcompete others (‘trait-hierarchy'). Either or both of these mechanisms may drive competitive exclusion, but their relative importance and interacting effects are rarely studied. Here, we explore empirically whether trait-similarity and trait-hierarchy can explain fine-scale spatial associations observed between invasive and native ant species in a tropical assemblage. We find that pairwise co-occurrences between the invasive red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta and 28 other species across relatively homogenous grasslands can be explained largely by an interaction of trait-similarity and trait-hierarchy in a single morphological trait, relative pronotum width. Specifically, higher trait-hierarchy values are associated with negative co-occurrences; however, these effects are counteracted when species are increasingly dissimilar in their trait ranges. These findings are consistent with the notion that limiting similarity and competitive hierarchies are interactive rather than discrete mechanisms driving competitive exclusion.},

abstract = {Aim: The observed decrease in insect colour lightness with increasing latitude has been explained in earlier macroecological studies by the increased solar absorption of dark coloration, which allows extended periods of activity. However, melanin-based dark coloration also protects against pathogens and ultraviolet radiation, which select for dark coloration at low latitudes where these selection pressures intensify. In nocturnal insects, the relative importance of these protective functions of dark coloration is expected to surpass thermoregulatory functions, as nocturnal species cannot benefit from extended periods of activity during the daytime. Hence, we expected that diurnal and nocturnal insects show contrasting geographical patterns of colour lightness. We tested these predictions using geometrid moths, which comprise both diurnal and nocturnal species. Location: Western Palearctic. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Geometridae (Lepidoptera). Methods: We used digital image analysis to assess the colour lightness of 637 species, compiled their distribution across 3,777 grid cells of 50 km × 50 km and calculated the assemblage-based average colour lightness. We used multiple regressions, autoregressive error models and randomizations to test for relationships between colour lightness and environmental variables associated with the thermal environment, putative pathogen pressure and ultraviolet radiation. Results: We found a clear decrease in colour lightness of assemblages of both diurnal and nocturnal moth species with increasing latitude. In every model, solar radiation was the most important predictor of colour lightness; that is, colour lightness consistently increased with increasing solar radiation. Main conclusions: These results indicate that the thermal environment is the most influential climatic driver of insect colour lightness—independent of thermoregulatory strategy and nocturnal or diurnal activity. This challenges the view that extended periods of activity are the main selection pressure for geographical variation in insect colour lightness. Consequently, the relationship between insect colour lightness and the thermal environment might be more general than previously thought.},

Bergmann's rule states that organisms inhabiting colder environments show an increase in body size or mass in comparison to their conspecifics living in warmer climates.Although originally proposed for homoeothermic vertebrates, this rule was later extended to ectotherms.

In this study, data from 53 nests collected along altitudinal gradients in the Alps were used to test the hypotheses that the worker body size and colony size of the ant Leptothorax acervorum increase with increasing altitude and therefore follow Bergmann's rule. 3. The results show that the body size of workers but not the colony size increases with altitude.

abstract = {The trait-based approach to ecology promises to provide a mechanistic understanding of species distributions and ecosystem functioning. Typically, trait analyses focus on average species trait values and assume that intraspecific variation is small or negligible. Recent work has shown, however, that intraspecific trait variation can often contribute substantially to total trait variation. Whilst many studies have investigated intraspecific variation in plants, very few have done so for invertebrates. There is no research on the level of intraspecific trait variation in ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), despite the fact that there is a growing body of literature using ant morphological trait data and demonstrating that these insects play important roles in many ecosystems and food webs. Here, we investigate the intraspecific variability of four commonly used ant morphological traits from 23 species from the Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains of southern Africa. In total, we measured 1145 different individuals and made 6870 trait measurements. Intraspecific variation accounted for only 1–4{\%} of total trait variation for each of the four traits we analysed. We found no links between intraspecific variation, phylogeny and elevation. On average, six individuals generated robust species means but under biased sampling scenarios 20 individuals were needed. The low levels of intraspecific morphological variation that we find suggest that the approach of using mean species traits is valid, in this fauna at least. Regardless, we encourage ant trait ecologists to measure greater numbers of individuals, especially across gradients, to shed further light on intraspecific variation in this functionally important group of insects.},

abstract = {In terrestrial walking organisms, long legs help to decrease the cost of running, allowing animals to step over environmental interstices rather than walking through them. However, long legs can complicate the infiltration of these interstices, which may contain food sources and refugia. Since the number of environmental interstices perceived by an organism (rugosity) increases as it body size decreases (size-grain hypothesis, SGH), natural selection should favor proportionally smaller legs with decreasing body size. Recent work demonstrated that ants fit this hypothesis. We experimentally tested the assumption of the SGH that small ants, which have proportionally smaller legs than larger ants, are more successful in exploring environmental interstices because they can easily penetrate them. We examined the ability of tropical litter ant species with different body sizes to access food baits in 'landscapes' (= plots) with different levels of rugosity and food exposure. In the first experiment, three levels of landscape rugosity were defined by manipulating the density of leaf litter placed on the ground plots: a) plain landscape: no litter fall, b) intermediate rugosity (∼ 0.5 kg of litter fall) and c) high rugosity (∼ 1 kg). In a second experiment, food baits were in plain landscapes, exposed or covered by leaf litter. The body lengths of ants that first accessed food baits ranged from 1.5 to 12 mm. Ants that first reached food baits in the most rugose landscapes were ∼ 40{\%} smaller than ants that first found baits in plain landscapes. Smaller ants were also the first to access covered food. The application of a phylogenetic comparative method suggested the same patterns. We conclude that these results support the size grain hypothesis. Environmental rugosity might have operated as a selective force to shape the morphological characteristics of litter ant species.},

abstract = {Aim: In ectotherms, the colour of an individual's cuticle may have important thermoregulatory and protective consequences. In cool environments, ectotherms should be darker, to maximize heat gain, and larger, to minimize heat loss. Dark colours should also predominate under high UV-B conditions because melanin offers protection. We test these predictions in ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) across space and through time based on a new, spatially and temporally explicit, global-scale combination of assemblage-level and environmental data. Location: Africa, Australia and South America. Methods: We sampled ant assemblages (n = 274) along 14 elevational transects on three continents. Individual assemblages ranged from 250 to 3000 m a.s.l. (minimum to maximum range in summer temperature of 0.5–35 °C). We used mixed-effects models to explain variation in assemblage cuticle lightness. Explanatory variables were average assemblage body size, temperature and UV-B irradiation. Annual temporal changes in lightness were examined for a subset of the data. Results: Assemblages with large average body sizes were darker in colour than those with small body sizes. Assemblages became lighter in colour with increasing temperature, but darkened again at the highest temperatures when there were high levels of UV-B. Through time, temperature and body size explained variation in lightness. Both the spatial and temporal models explained c. 50{\%} of the variation in lightness. Main conclusions: Our results are consistent with the thermal melanism hypothesis, and demonstrate the importance of considering body size and UV-B radiation exposure in explaining the colour of insect cuticle. Crucially, this finding is at the assemblage level. Consequently, the relative abundances and identities of ant species that are present in an assemblage can change in accordance with environmental conditions over elevation, latitude and relatively short time spans. These findings suggest that there are important constraints on how ectotherm assemblages may be able to respond to rapidly changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {1. The nutrient supply network model of the metabolic theory of ecology predicts that metabolic rate scales as mass0.75 at all hierarchical levels. 2. An alternative, cell size, model suggests that the scaling of metabolic rate is a by-product of the way in which body size changes, by cell size or number, or some combination thereof. It predicts a scaling exponent of mass0.75 at the widest interspecific level, but values of mass 0.67-1.0 for lower taxonomic groups or within species. 3. Here these predictions are tested in insects using 391 species for the interspecific analysis, and the size-polymorphic workers of eight ant species at the intraspecific level. In the latter, the contribution of ommatidium size and number to variation in body length, which is closely related to eye size, is used to assess the relative contributions of changes in cell size and number to variation in body size. 4. Before controlling for phylogeny, metabolic rate scaled interspecifically as mass0.82. Following phylogenetic correction, metabolic rate scaled as mass0.75. 5. By contrast, the intraspecific scaling exponents varied from 0.67 to 1.0. Moreover, in the species where metabolic rate scaled as mass1.0, cell size did not contribute significantly to models of body size variation, only cell number was significant. Where the scaling exponent was {\textless} 1.0, cell size played an increasingly important role in accounting for size variation. 6. Data for one of the largest groups of organisms on earth are therefore inconsistent with the nutrient supply network model, but provide support for the cell size alternative. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},
