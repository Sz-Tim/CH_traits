# Intra- and interspecific variation in traits in Swiss ants

In ants, traits vary among workers. Past work along environmental gradients has primarily focused on how traits vary among species or communities, relying on a single species-wide average value for each trait. Some work has also explored variation within species across an elevational gradient, though with either limited taxonomic scope (i.e., focused on one species) or limitations on the applicability within a eusocial taxon due to logistical constraints (i.e., colonies were not adequately addressed). However, as eusocial insects, variation within a species is not necessarily the correct focus. The success of a colony does not rely on what would be the success of each individual worker, but rather the collective success of all of the workers. 

This project investigates patterns and drivers of traits in ants, including correlations among traits, the distribution of trait variation across biological levels, and patterns of the mean and variance of traits within colonies for species across multiple genera along an environmental gradient.
