### Overview 

In ants, traits vary among workers. Past work along environmental gradients has primarily focused on how traits vary among species or communities, relying on a single species-wide average value for each trait. Some work has also explored variation within species across an elevational gradient, though with either limited taxonomic scope (i.e., focused on one species) or limitations on the applicability within a eusocial taxon due to logistical constraints (i.e., colonies were not adequately addressed). 

As eusocial insects, analyses of trait variation within ant species *must* account for the existence of colonies. The correct focus is on how trait values vary among colonies, rather than only among workers. The success of a colony does not rely on the success of any individual worker, but rather the collective success of all of the workers. As a consequence, the *distribution* of traits within a colony is more precisely what is of interest, rather than only the average trait value. 

This project investigates patterns and drivers of traits in ants, including correlations among traits, the distribution of trait variation across biological levels, and patterns of the mean and variance of traits within colonies for species across multiple genera along an environmental gradient.
