#  I: Intra- & interspecific variation in thermal-related traits

--------  
## Theory  

H1. Premise: Total community abundance is limited by the available energy in the local ecosystem
	Premise: Populations with lower abundances are more susceptible to chance extirpation
	Premise: Species with low per-individual energy requirements can attain higher densities on average
	Ergo 1:	 Species with low per-individual energy requirements should be more common in low energy environments
	
H2. Premise: Colony success is determined by the total resources able to be acquired
	Premise: Low energy environments require more search time per unit of acquired energy
	Premise: Extreme temperatures constrain the time an individual can forage
	Premise: Colonies can extend the range of foraging temperatures with variability in worker thermal tolerance
	Ergo 2a: Cold, low energy environments should select for colonies with high variance in thermal traits
	Ergo 2b: Thermal-related traits should covary within individual workers
	
H3. Premise: The genetic or behavioural mechanisms driving intraspecific variation are phylogenetically conserved
	Premise: The degree of polymorphism varies among subfamilies and genera
	Premise: The predisposition for variability within a clade allows more variation within species on average
	Ergo 3a: Genera with more variation should also show more variation within each species
	Ergo 3b: Genera with more polymorphic species should show more variation within each species

## Questions  

1.	Do low energy environments select for species with lower per-colony mass?
2a.	Do low energy environments select for increased variation in intraspecific body size and colour?
2b.	Is variation in colour and body size among workers correlated?
3a.	Are trends in variation different among genera or subfamilies? 
3b.	Are taxa with a high prevalence of polymorphism more likely to show strong trends in intraspecific variation?

## Outcomes  

1.	T:	Theory holds for eusocial organisms at relevant level of biology
	F: 	a. Energy not actually limiting
		b. Populations not really isolated across elevations, so potential rescue effect
		c. Colony size varies across elevations, but could not measure it
		d. Population density within species does not correlate well with body size / energy requirements
2.	T:	Very cool, somewhat contradicting Gaudard 2019
	F:	a. Colony success not tightly related to resource acquisition
		b. Insufficient variation in short-term temperature to warrant much variation
		c. Other constraints (e.g., genetic...?) limiting variation in worker morphology
3.	T:	Suggested phylogenetic predisposition to variability
	F:	a. Species are more idiosyncratic -- flexible or fast evolving?
		b. Interactions with unmeasured traits (queen number - Schwander et al 2005)
		c. Polymorphism is a different thing than just variability

## Covariates  

1.	NPP, MAT, MAP, elevation -- Theory is just about available energy, so ~ NPP
2.	NPP, MAT, MAP, DTR, Tmin/max.summer, cloud cover -- Theory combines energy available and foraging conditions
3.	Proportion species polymorphic global, within Europe, within CH? Genus-level phylogeny?


--------  
## Issues  

- How to deal with polymorphism in measurements? We collected workers haphazardly. Which species have majors/minors?
- Little to no data on colony size. Need to assume constant within species. Not sure about data availability.
- Get covariates at appropriate scale. Sources for Tmin/max, DTR, cloud cover?
